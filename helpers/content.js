            content: "<p>Welcome to Neo4j. For a Java or JVM-language developer, Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities. Make sure to have looked at our information on <a href='/learn/graphdatabase'>graph databases</a> and Neo4j in general. You should also check out our graph query language Cypher which makes it very easy to get going regardless of the development platform.</p>\
    <p>Neo4j comes in two flavors. The standalone Neo4j-Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its REST API. You can then use whatever REST-library you choose for any JVM language. The dedicated Neo4j drivers go beyond that by offering comprehensive APIs for integrating with graph based applications.</p>\
    <p>But you can also run Neo4j embedded in your JVM process, much like HSQL or Derby. This is great for unit testing, but also for high performance / no-network setups. If you use Neo4j embedded you can use the Neo4j Core-API directly. Besides an object oriented approach to the graph database, working with Nodes, Relationships and Paths, it also offers highly customizable high-speed traversal- and graph-algorithm implementations. You can also choose from any useful wrapping drivers that exist either for specific programming languages or that add interesting functionality.</p>\
    <p>One example is Spring Data Neo4j which integrates tightly with the SpringFramework and offers Object-Graph mapping on top of Neo4j. Just to tease your interest - there are hundreds of open source Neo4j-related ecosystem projects, example applications and tutorials that can spark new ideas and possibilities.</p>\
    <p>As a JVM developer you are also on the bright side when it comes to pouring large amounts of data into Neo4j. With its non-transactional batch-insertion facilities it can ingest millions of nodes and relationships in just seconds.</p>"
